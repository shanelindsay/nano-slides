title: What this repo does
subtitle: High-level overview

text:
  bullets:
    - You write an outline of your talk as structured YAML
    - Each slide has a title, text, layout hints, and optional assets
    - The Python tool builds prompts and calls Gemini to generate images
    - The result is a folder of ready-to-present slide images

visual: |
  Title at the top, single content block beneath. On the right, a small grid of
  3–4 slide thumbnails hinting at generated images.

notes: |
  Outline + style in, slide images out; not a PDF summariser.

text:
  columns:
    - heading: Old way
      bullets:
        - Build each slide manually in PowerPoint
        - Search for icons, tweak layouts, align boxes
        - Style drifts between slides and projects
    - heading: New way
      bullets:
        - Define style once in a style file
        - Describe slides in YAML (titles, bullets, visuals)
        - Batch render consistent slide images with one command

visual: |
  Two-column composition. Left: scattered pieces hinting at manual assembly.
