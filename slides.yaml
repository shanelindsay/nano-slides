style: chalkboard:default
generate: true

title: Slide Decks from AI Images
subtitle: How this repo turns outlines into finished slides

text:
  bullets: []

visual: |
  Clean modern academic title slide. Light grey background, large left-aligned
  title, subtitle underneath, and a small abstract graphic on the right that
  suggests slides or windows stacking. Nothing flashy, just tidy and readable.

assets: []

notes: |
  Open with the core idea: this repo takes structured slide descriptions and
  uses Gemini to render full slide images in a consistent visual style.
---
slide: 2
type: section
layout: section_header
style: chalkboard:default
generate: true

title: What this repo is for
subtitle: From hand-built decks to rendered decks

text:
  bullets: []

visual: |
  Simple section header slide. Large title in the centre-left, a thin blue
  accent line underneath, and a faint abstract background shape. No charts
  or bullet points, just a clear section divider.

assets: []

notes: |
  Short transition slide to mark the "motivation / overview" part of the talk.
---
slide: 3
type: content
layout: title_and_content
style: chalkboard:default
generate: true

title: What this repo does
subtitle: High-level overview

text:
  bullets:
    - You write an outline of your talk as structured YAML
    - Each slide has a title, text, layout hints, and optional assets
    - The Python tool builds prompts and calls Gemini to generate images
    - The result is a folder of ready-to-present slide images

visual: |
  Title at the top, single content block beneath. On the right side, a small
  thumbnail grid of three or four slide previews, hinting at the generated
  images. Keep everything flat and minimal.

assets: []

notes: |
  Explain that the repo is an "outline + style in, slide images out" system,
  not an automatic summariser of random PDFs.

slide: 4
type: content
layout: two_content
style: chalkboard:default
generate: true

title: Old vs new workflow
subtitle: Why bother?

text:
  columns:
    - heading: Old way
      bullets:
        - Build each slide manually in PowerPoint
        - Search for icons, tweak layouts, align boxes
        - Style drifts between slides and projects
    - heading: New way
      bullets:
        - Define style once in a style file
        - Describe slides in YAML (titles, bullets, visuals)
        - Batch render consistent slide images with one command

visual: |
  Clear two-column composition: left column titled "Old way", right column
  "New way". Light vertical guide separating the two. Small abstract icon or
  mini diagram above each column, but keep text as the main focus.

assets: []

notes: |
  Contrast manual deck-building against the generative approach, both in
  effort and in visual consistency.

slide: 5
type: content
layout: picture_with_caption
style: chalkboard:default
generate: true

title: How the pipeline works
subtitle: Style, outline, engine

text:
  bullets:
    - Style: a style file (e.g. modern_academic) and a reference image
    - Outline: slides.yaml with titles, text, layout and assets
    - Engine: Python tools that call Gemini to render each slide
    - Output: generated_slides/ images + HTML viewer

visual: |
  Large schematic diagram on the left: three labelled boxes in a row:
  "Style", "Outline (YAML)", "Engine". An arrow flows into a block labelled
  "Rendered slides", shown as 3-4 miniature slide thumbnails.
  On the right is the text caption area with bullets.

assets: []

notes: |
  This slide is the conceptual architecture: inputs (style + outline),
  processing (tools/generate_slides.py, gemini_generate_image.py), and
  outputs (images + index.html).
---
slide: 6
type: image_only
layout: blank
style: chalkboard:default
generate: true

title: Example rendered slide
subtitle: (image-only demo)

text: {}

visual: |
  Full-screen example slide in the modern academic style that could plausibly
  be one of the outputs from this repo. Light background, clear title,
  a small chart or diagram, and a few neat labels. Avoid extra text overlays
  beyond what naturally belongs on the slide.

assets: []

notes: |
  This slide is meant to be almost entirely visual: a single strong example
  of what the model will generate for you. The title and subtitle can be
  present as part of the image.
---
slide: 7
type: content
layout: title_and_content
style: chalkboard:default
generate: true

title: "Alternative style: Chalkboard"
subtitle: Same repo, different look

text:
  bullets:
    - Swap style: use chalkboard instead of modern_academic
    - Keep the same slides.yaml structure and content
    - Get a completely different visual feel automatically
    - Useful for teaching, workshops, or informal talks

visual: |
  Chalkboard-style slide: dark green/charcoal board, white chalk title at
  the top, a few chalk bullets, and a simple chalk sketch (e.g. a slide
  icon or a small flow diagram). Make sure text is clear and legible.

assets: []

notes: |
  Show that styles are pluggable: the same pipeline and slide YAML can render
  into very different visual treatments by changing the style file and style
  code on each slide.
