  Cinematic Glass Garden hero slide: a glowing frosted-glass banana at the center,
  with subtle UI cards floating around it. Strong central title, soft off-white
  background, premium calm vibe.

  Introduce the idea: this repo turns outlines and style rules into fully
  rendered slide images using Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview.

title: From assembling to rendering

text:
  columns:
    - heading: Old workflow
      bullets:
        - Build slides directly in PowerPoint/Keynote
        - Drag boxes, icons, screenshots by hand
        - Visual style drifts slide to slide
    - heading: Generative Kernel workflow
      bullets:
        - Define visual language once (styles/)
        - Describe each slide in YAML
        - Batch render slides with Gemini

visual: |
  Two-column scene: left shows a messy collage of flat icons/boxes; right shows
  a clean Glass Garden workbench with elegant frosted-glass UI cards, representing
  the rendered pipeline. Emphasize contrast: chaos -> order.

notes: |
  Core philosophy: treat the deck as a rendered artifact, not hand-assembled shapes.

title: How the repo works

text:
  bullets:
    - Style: styles/glass_garden.md (or your pack)
    - Outline: YAML slides with text + visual hints + assets
    - Engine: Python tools calling Gemini image preview
    - Output: generated_slides/ + Reveal.js viewer

visual: |
  Schematic: on the left, three floating glass cards labeled "Style", "Outline",
  and "Engine" feed into a glowing prism. On the right, finished slide tiles emerge
  in a neat grid (the images in generated_slides/).

notes: |
  Walk through key files: styles/..., slides.yaml, tools/generate_slides.py,
  tools/gemini_generate_image.py, index.html.

title: "Your fork: outline + styles"
subtitle: Controlled creativity

text:
  bullets:
    - Write your talk as YAML slides with titles, bullets, visuals
    - Swap style packs by changing style (e.g., glass_garden:default)
    - Let Gemini handle composition/lighting
    - Iterate with 1K drafts, then upscale to 4K

visual: |
  Glass Garden dashboard showing style chips (Glass, Chalkboard, Minimal Academic)
  and a stack of outline cards. A beam of light connects them to a row of finished
  slide images, implying outlines + style pack generate many decks.

assets:

notes: |
  Emphasize deliberate outlines + style packs; the model renders the scenes.
