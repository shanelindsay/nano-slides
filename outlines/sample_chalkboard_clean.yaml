title: Building Slide Decks with AI Images
subtitle: Outline-driven generation

text:
  bullets: []

visual: |
  Title near the top, simple supporting sketch on the right showing a stack of slides turning into a single framed slide. Leave generous negative space.

notes: |
  Intro to the idea: you describe slides in YAML, pick a style, and render full images.

type: section
layout: section_header
generate: true

title: How it works
subtitle: From outline to rendered slides

text:
  bullets: []

visual: |
  Section divider with the title and a thin underline. Keep the background calm so the title stands out.

notes: |
  Transition into the mechanics of the pipeline.

slide: 3
type: content
layout: title_and_content
generate: true

title: Outline, style, engine
subtitle: Three inputs

text:
  bullets:
    - Outline: YAML with titles, bullets, layout hints
    - Style: style pack plus a reference image
    - Engine: Python tool that builds prompts and calls the image model
    - Output: a folder of ready-to-present slide images

visual: |
  Simple diagram with three labeled cards feeding into one output card. Keep shapes clean and easy to read.

notes: |
  The deck is driven by structured outline + style, not by guessing from arbitrary docs.

title: Manual vs generated
subtitle: Why bother?

text:
  columns:
    - heading: Manual decks
      bullets:
        - Assemble slides one by one
        - Search for icons and align boxes
        - Visual style drifts over time
    - heading: Generated decks
      bullets:
        - Describe each slide once in YAML
        - Reuse the same style pack
        - Batch render consistent images

visual: |
  Two-column composition. Left side: scattered pieces hinting at manual assembly. Right side: tidy set of slide thumbnails emerging from a single pipeline.

notes: |
  Contrast effort and consistency between hand-made slides and rendered slides.

slide: 5
type: content
layout: picture_with_caption
generate: true

title: Pipeline overview
subtitle: Inputs to outputs

text:
  bullets:
    - Inputs: style file and reference image
    - Outline: slides.yaml with titles, text, layout, and assets
    - Engine: generate_slides.py builds prompts per slide
    - Outputs: images, per-run index, optional PDF

visual: |
  Left side: simple flow with three boxes labeled Style, Outline, Engine leading to a group of slide images. Right side reserved for the text bullets.

notes: |
  Keep the diagram minimal so the text remains readable.

slide: 6
type: image_only
layout: blank
generate: true

title: Example rendered slide
subtitle: Visual-only demo

text: {}

visual: |
  A sample slide scene with a clear title area and a small chart or diagram. Avoid extra body text; the goal is to show a finished slide image.

notes: |
  Use this as a visual proof of what the generator produces.
