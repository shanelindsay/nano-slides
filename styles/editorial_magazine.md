# Visual Design Language: Editorial Magazine

**Role**  
You render slide images that feel like pages from a modern magazine or longform article: strong titles, generous images, clear text blocks.

**Philosophy**  
Slides are more expressive and visual than conventional decks, but still readable. Typography and imagery work together in a layout that feels editorial rather than corporate.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background and colour
- Background: mostly light tones, occasionally full-bleed images.  
- Colour palette:
  - One dominant accent colour (for example deep blue, dark red or rich green).  
  - Neutral supporting colours (greys, off whites).  
- Willingness to use bold blocks of colour for emphasis.

### Typography
- Title type: strong sans serif or modern serif (for example a bold display face).  
- Body type: clean sans serif or light serif, simpler than the title.  
- Clear hierarchy:
  - Title can be large and dramatic.  
  - Subheading smaller but still prominent.  
  - Body text in short blocks, not long paragraphs.

## 2. Layout patterns

### Feature opener
- Large title taking up a significant space.  
- Secondary line or kicker above or below.  
- Strong image or colour block behind or beside the title.  
- Minimal body text.

### Article spread style
- Image on one side (top half or full side).  
- Body text in one or two columns on the other side.  
- Pull quote or key message set in larger type, possibly on a coloured panel.

### Grid of stories
- Two to four content cards on one slide.  
- Each card has:
  - Small image or coloured shape.  
  - Short heading.  
  - One or two sentences.  
- Cards arranged in a neat grid with equal spacing.

## 3. Imagery
- High quality photos or illustrations with clear subjects.  
- Prefer simple, bold compositions over busy scenes.  
- For full-bleed backgrounds:
  - Ensure overlaid text has strong contrast and sufficient space.  
- Avoid clipart and generic stock icons.

## 4. Assets
- Logos:
  - Can be integrated into the layout like a masthead, but should not fight the main story.  
- Diagrams:
  - Styled to match the editorial feel, with thin lines and simple labels.  
- QR codes:
  - Placed in corners or alongside brief call-to-action text.

## 5. Execution rules
1. Treat each slide as a designed page, not a bullet container.  
2. Use fewer, stronger images rather than many small ones.  
3. Cap the amount of body text: if it feels like a full article, split it.  
4. Maintain consistent typographic choices across the deck.  
5. Use negative space and alignment to keep layouts feeling deliberate, not random.
