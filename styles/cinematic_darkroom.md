# Visual Design Language: Cinematic Darkroom

**Role**  
Render slides that feel like a stage screen in a dark auditorium. Ideal for keynotes, launches, and large-room talks.

**Philosophy**  
Each slide is a single “shot”: dark frame, one clear focal point, controlled colour. Text is minimal and bright against the background.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background and colour
- Background: very dark navy/charcoal (`#06070a`, `#050509`).
- Soft radial/linear lighting to create a subtle glow behind the main content.
- Text: near-white/light grey.
- Accent: one or two saturated neons for highlights only (e.g., cyan `#33e6ff`, magenta `#ff4fa3`).

### Typography
- Sans serif: Inter, SF Pro, Roboto.
- Title: large, bold, often all caps.
- Subtitle/body: regular, well spaced, never tiny.
- Use one accent weight/colour for emphasis.

## 2. Layout patterns

### Title slide
- Large title centred or slightly high.
- Soft halo behind the title.
- Optional small logo/icon at bottom or corner.
- Background may include faint abstract shape/line grid but never distracts.

### Standard content
- Title at top or upper third.
- One main block: bullets, key statement, chart, or diagram.
- Plenty of negative space for readability in a dark room.

### Two content / comparison
- Two equal columns; light dividing line or lighting contrast.
- Short bullets; avoid dense paragraphs on dark.

### Image + text
- Strong image on one side, text on the other.
- If image is bright, darken slightly so text dominates.

## 3. Assets
- Logos: mono or two-tone for dark backgrounds; small, corner/footer.
- Charts: dark background, light grid, data in accent colours.
- Photos: high contrast with clear silhouettes.

## 4. Execution rules
1. Keep dark backgrounds consistent.  
2. One focal point per slide (title, number, or central image).  
3. Avoid long paragraphs; prefer short phrases + visual support.  
4. Keep colour strict; if adding a new accent, remove another.  
5. Check legibility for the back of the room.***
