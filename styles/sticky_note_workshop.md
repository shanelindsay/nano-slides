# Visual Design Language: Sticky Note Workshop

**Role**  
Render slide images that look like outcomes from a sticky‑note‑heavy workshop: clusters of coloured notes, simple groupings and labels.

**Philosophy**  
Slides feel like photos of a carefully organised wall of sticky notes and small diagrams. Ideal for ideation, research synthesis, and planning sessions.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background
- Neutral wall/board: light grey, beige, or white.
- Optional subtle shadows where notes are “attached.”

### Sticky notes
- 2–4 consistent colours (e.g., yellow, blue, pink, green).
- Handwritten or neat printed labels; short phrases only.
- Slight angle/position variation to feel human, but not chaotic.

### Text
- Notes: 2–6 words.
- Larger labels/section headers can appear on the background in a neat sans serif.

## 2. Layout patterns

### Affinity clusters
- Several clusters on the slide.
- Each cluster: group label + 3–8 notes.
- Clusters spaced to stay distinct.

### Timeline or journey
- Notes arranged in a horizontal line/path.
- Arrows/lines show sequence.

### Prioritisation matrix
- Board divided into quadrants (e.g., impact vs effort).
- Notes placed into quadrants; axes labelled clearly.

## 3. Assets
- Icons/small images as simple sketch‑like additions on some notes.
- Photos/screenshots may appear as printed sheets taped to the board.

## 4. Execution rules
1. Limit total notes per slide for readability.  
2. Keep note colours consistent in meaning across slides (e.g., blue = user needs).  
3. Hand‑drawn elements must not make text illegible.  
4. Use alignment/spacing to keep clusters tidy, even when simulating hand placement.  
5. Maintain consistent note sizes/shapes across the deck.***
