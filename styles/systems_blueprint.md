# Visual Design Language: Systems Blueprint

**Role**  
Render slide images that look like technical system blueprints: clean lines, structured diagrams, and calm, engineering‑led layouts.

**Philosophy**  
Slides feel like architectural/engineering schematics translated for software, pipelines, or experimental setups. Ideal for systems‑level talks and architecture reviews.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background and colour
- Background: muted blue‑grey or off‑white (`#f4f7fb` or `#e6ecf5`).  
- Lines/shapes: dark blue or charcoal for main outlines; lighter lines for grid/secondary structure.  
- Accent: one bright accent (e.g., orange or green) to highlight key components.

### Typography
- Clean sans serif: Inter, Roboto, or similar.
- Titles bold, slightly larger.
- Labels small but legible.
- Consistent naming/case for components.

## 2. Diagram patterns

### High‑level architecture
- Boxes for components/services.
- Arrows for data/control flow.
- Clear tier separation (frontend/backend/data).
- Labels near boxes/arrows without overlap.

### Sequence or pipeline
- Horizontal/vertical chain of boxes.
- Each step with short label; optional stage numbers.

### Deployment / network
- Nodes grouped into zones (e.g., Client, Edge, Core, Cloud).
- Faint rectangles/backgrounds behind zones.
- Solid/dashed lines for different connection types.

## 3. Layout patterns

### Title plus diagram
- Title at top.
- One large central diagram.
- Short bullet summary beneath or beside.

### Two‑panel compare
- Left diagram: current system.
- Right diagram: proposed system.
- Shared legend at bottom.

## 4. Assets
- Icons: simple, flat, for servers/databases/queues; not cartoonish.
- Screenshots: rare; prefer redrawn schematics over GUI captures.

---

## 5. Execution rules
1. Prioritise structural clarity over visual flair.  
2. Keep line weights/box styles consistent within/across slides.  
3. Don’t cram more than one or two major diagrams per slide.  
4. Use accent colour only for the most important elements.  
5. Align boxes/arrows cleanly; diagrams should feel engineered, not improvised.
