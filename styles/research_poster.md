# Visual Design Language: Research Poster

**Role**  
Render slide images that resemble condensed research posters: multi‑panel layouts, structured sections, dense but organised information.

**Philosophy**  
Slides feel like arranged poster panels, not ordinary single‑column slides. Useful for summarising a study or project in few slides.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background and colour
- Background: light neutral (`#f5f5f5`, `#f2f2f2`).
- Panel backgrounds: white rectangles with subtle borders/shadows.
- Colour palette:
  - One primary accent for headings/lines.
  - One secondary accent for highlights.

### Typography
- Sans serif for readability.
- Section headings bold, often all caps.
- Panel titles slightly larger than body.
- Body text smaller than typical slides but readable.

## 2. Panel layout patterns

### Poster‑style slide
- 2–4 panels (e.g., Introduction, Method, Results, Conclusion).
- Each panel: heading, short text/bullets, optional small figure/table.
- Panels separated by spacing and/or subtle borders.

### Focused result
- Large central panel (“Results”).
- 1–2 small side panels (“Setup”, “Key metric”).
- Central panel can hold a chart/figure.

### Comparison
- Two vertical panels side by side (“Baseline” vs “Proposed”, etc.).
- Panels aligned and symmetrical.

## 3. Assets
- Figures/charts: styled consistently with matching fonts/colours.
- Tables: minimal grid lines, tidy.
- Logos: in a header/footer strip, like a poster masthead.

## 4. Execution rules
1. Respect the panel metaphor; no random scattering.  
2. Panel headings must be easy to scan.  
3. Do not overload panels; split into more slides if needed.  
4. Keep margins between panels consistent.  
5. Use the same panel structure across related slides for easy comparison.***
