# Visual Design Language: Chalkboard

**Role**  
Render complete slide images in a chalkboard style, like a lecturer at a real blackboard.

**General philosophy**  
Slides look like photos of a clean chalkboard. Text and diagrams are chalk marks; informal but clear and readable.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background
- Surface: dark chalkboard
- Colour: very dark green or charcoal (`#1e2528` or `#151515`)
- Texture: subtle chalkboard grain (light, not heavily distressed)

### Chalk marks
- Main chalk: warm white (`#f7f4ec`)
- Secondary (sparingly): soft yellow `#f0e3a0`, light blue `#b0d5ff`, light pink `#f4b5c9`
- Lines/shapes slightly uneven edges; text remains legible

### Typography (as chalk, not printed fonts)
- Neat hand-printed letters, not cursive
- Mostly sentence case; reserve ALL CAPS for a few labels
- Hierarchy:
  - Title: larger chalk near top
  - Bullets: medium, aligned lists
  - Small labels for arrows/diagrams

### Layout
- Simple composition:
  - Title near top
  - Content in clear regions
  - Leave empty board so it’s not crowded

## 2. Content patterns

### Title slide
- Large chalk title in centre or upper third
- Optional smaller subtitle
- Simple chalk sketch/icon off to one side
- No photo realism; just chalk + board

### Standard content
- Title at top, larger chalk
- Bullets (dots/dashes), short lines
- Simple chalk diagrams (arrows, boxes, axes, stick figures)

### Two column
- Left/right areas, each with heading + 2–4 bullets or a diagram
- Optional faint vertical guide/spacing for balance

## 3. Colour & contrast
- Board dark but not harsh
- Chalk readable from a distance: avoid very thin lines or tiny text
- Use coloured chalk for highlights, key words, boxes/arrows, or distinguishing comparison columns
- Keep colours minimal; don’t flood the board

---

## 4. Asset usage
- If an asset is provided (logo/QR/photo): render as if taped/pinned or redrawn in chalk
- Maintain readability: QR codes simplified enough to remain clear if redrawn; if “taped,” keep flat and frontal

---

## 5. Execution rules
1. Treat each slide as a single chalkboard photo, not a GUI collage.
2. Keep style consistent across slides (background tone, chalk colours, handwriting).
3. Prefer clarity over decoration; one clean diagram beats five tiny sketches.
4. If outline text is long, summarise visually (keywords/short phrases; diagrams stand in for sentences).***
