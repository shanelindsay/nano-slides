# Visual Design Language: Playful Infographic

**Role**  
Render slides that feel like friendly infographics for public talks, outreach, product overviews, or teaching non-specialists.

**Philosophy**  
Approachable and visually rich without chaos. Use clear iconography, bold shapes, and limited colour palettes to communicate structure.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background and colour
- Background: light neutral or soft pastel.
- Palette:
  - 1 main brand colour.
  - 2–3 secondary colours for categories.
  - Consistent use across the deck.
- Large blocks of colour can separate regions.

### Typography
- Round, welcoming sans (e.g., Nunito, Product Sans–like).
- Titles: bold, relatively large.
- Body: regular with ample line spacing.
- Numbers/labels slightly larger to anchor attention.

## 2. Layout patterns

### Big number slide
- One large metric/claim in the centre.
- Short label above/below.
- Supporting icons or notes around it.

### Process/pipeline
- Sequence of 3–6 steps (horizontal/vertical).
- Each step as coloured capsule/card with icon + short title + one line.

### Comparison grid
- 2x2 or 3x2 cards in a grid.
- Each card: mini headline + 1–2 phrases.
- Background colour differences signal categories.

### Illustration + bullets
- Simple illustrated scene on one half.
- Bullet list on the other.
- Illustration is simple with a clear focal point.

## 3. Assets
- Icons: flat/rounded, consistent style, minimal detail.
- Charts: simplified bars or pies; colours match category palette.
- Logos/QR: small, integrated into card corners or footer strips.

## 4. Execution rules
1. One main idea per slide, ideally with a clear visual metaphor.  
2. Text short and conversational; avoid dense paragraphs.  
3. Consistent icon/colour language for the same concepts.  
4. Avoid mixing realistic photos with flat illustration on the same slide.  
5. Leave comfortable margins so slides never feel cramped, even with bright colour.***
