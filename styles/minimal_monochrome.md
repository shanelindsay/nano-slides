# Visual Design Language: Minimal Monochrome

**Role**  
Render slide images in a highly minimal, almost monochrome style. Ideal for serious talks where typography and structure carry the message.

**Philosophy**  
Use as few visual elements as possible. Rely on alignment, spacing and contrast instead of colour and decoration. Calm, precise, slightly austere.

---

## 1. Core visual style

### Background
- White or near‑white (`#fafafa`, `#f5f5f5`).
- No texture, gradients, or patterns.

### Colour
- Text/lines: greys only (`#111111` to `#666666`).
- Optional single accent (sparingly): muted blue `#3b5bdb` or muted red `#c92a2a`.
- Accents only as thin rules, small icons, or highlights.

### Typography
- One consistent family (sans or sober serif): Inter, Source Sans, IBM Plex Sans, or a single serif like Charter.
- Titles: bold, larger. Body: regular, smaller, generous line spacing.
- Avoid mixed fonts/weights on a single slide.

## 2. Layout patterns

### Title slide
- Title centred or left aligned.
- Tiny subtitle/name beneath.
- Optional thin rule or single accent dot/bar.
- No background imagery.

### Standard content
- Title at top.
- Single column: bullets, short paragraphs, simple diagram or formula.
- Large margins.

### Two column
- Two narrow columns with a clear gap.
- Each with heading + short bullets.
- Columns align top/bottom.

### Statement slide
- One short sentence or quote, large and centred.
- Maybe a tiny source line; nothing else.

## 3. Assets
- Diagrams: thin grey lines, no fills or shadows.
- Logos: small, monochrome if possible.
- Photos: rare; if used, greyscale and simple.

## 4. Execution rules
1. Remove anything not directly supporting the message.  
2. No decorative shapes, shadows, gradients.  
3. Keep line lengths moderate; avoid walls of text.  
4. Use consistent grid/margins for coherence.  
5. Use the accent only to direct the eye to a critical element.***
