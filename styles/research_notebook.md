# Visual Design Language: Research Notebook

**Role**  
Render slides that feel like tidy research notebook pages. Suitable for concept development, lab meetings, exploratory talks.

**Philosophy**  
Informal and human, but precise. Hand annotations, boxed headings, and small sketches carry the structure. Evoke a working mind, not a finished poster.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background and colour
- Off-white paper (`#f8f5ec`) with subtle grain.
- Optional faint ruled/dotted grid, very low contrast.
- Main ink: dark grey or deep blue.
- Secondary ink: muted red or green for emphasis/annotations.

### Typography/handwriting
- Printed text: clean sans mimicking neat notebook writing.
- Headings: slightly larger/bolder, often underlined.
- Annotations: smaller, near diagrams, can use coloured ink.

## 2. Layout patterns

### Topic page
- Page title at top, underlined.
- Section blocks separated by horizontal rules or boxes.
- Short bullets, equations, or small sketches in each block.

### Stepwise reasoning
- Vertical flow of numbered steps.
- Arrows linking blocks; marginal notes (“check”, “open question”).
- Space around each step for clarity.

### Concept map
- Central boxed concept.
- Branching boxes around with short labels.
- Curved arrows with small notes (“because”, “leads to”).

## 3. Assets
- Figures/charts: appear as printed inserts taped to the page; simple axes, handwritten-style labels.
- Photos: as printed photos with light border or tape corners.
- Logos: small, stamped in a corner like a lab/university seal.

## 4. Execution rules
1. Maintain the illusion of one notebook across slides (same paper/ink).  
2. Keep density moderate; if crowded, split to a new “page.”  
3. Use colour for structure (red = warnings/results; green = hypotheses).  
4. Diagrams stay simple/hand-drawn in spirit, not polished vector art.  
5. Preserve clarity of reasoning; the style supports thinking, not hiding.***
