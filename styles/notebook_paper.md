# Visual Design Language: Notebook Paper

**Role**  
Render slide images that feel like neat pages from a spiral notebook: lined paper, handwritten elements, simple sketches.

**Philosophy**  
Informal and approachable like lecture notes, but tidy enough for a talk.

## 1. Core visual style

### Background
- Light off‑white paper tone.
- Subtle horizontal ruled lines.
- Optional faint vertical margin line on the left.

### Colour
- Main text: dark ink‑like (`#1f2933`).
- Accent colours for headers/underlines: pen‑like blue, red, or green.

### Typography
- Either:
  - Neat pseudo‑handwritten font for titles/labels + clean sans for body, or
  - Consistent “handwritten print” style everywhere.
- Titles larger, often underlined/boxed.
- Body text: short phrases, not long paragraphs.

## 2. Layout patterns

### Topic page
- Title at top, possibly double‑underlined.
- Bullets/short paragraphs underneath.
- Simple sketches/arrows in margins.

### Worked example
- Small title at top.
- Steps numbered down the page: short text + small sketch/formula each step.
- Arrows indicating flow.

### Two‑column notes
- Page divided vertically:
  - Left: keywords/headings.
  - Right: explanations/elaborations.
- Margin line can reinforce division.

## 3. Assets
- Small images/diagrams: drawn as pasted or re‑sketched in pen.
- Logos: tiny, unobtrusive; like stamps or small stickers.

## 4. Execution rules
1. Maintain legibility; avoid genuinely messy handwriting.  
2. Keep the notebook motif subtle so content dominates.  
3. Use consistent line spacing and margin style across slides.  
4. Drawings/arrows guide attention, not fill space.  
5. If cluttered, split into two “pages.”***
